/**************  Arranging Coins ****************
*
* You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
*
* Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.
*
* n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
*
* Example 1:
*
* n = 5
*
* The coins can form the following rows:
* ¤
* ¤ ¤
* ¤ ¤
*
* Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
* Example 2:
*
* n = 8
*
* The coins can form the following rows:
* ¤
* ¤ ¤
* ¤ ¤ ¤
* ¤ ¤
*
* Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
